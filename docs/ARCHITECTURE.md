# BittyWorld Architecture

## Overview

BittyWorld is a decentralized Web3 gaming platform built on the Solana blockchain. The architecture is designed to support real-time multiplayer shooting battles with up to 8 players per room, multiple concurrent rooms, and seamless social interaction.

## System Components

### 1. Frontend (Client)
- Built with React/Next.js
- Real-time game rendering using Phaser.js
- Web3 integration with Solana wallet
- Real-time chat interface
- Room management system

### 2. Backend (Server)
- Node.js/Express server
- WebSocket server for real-time communication
- Room management and game state synchronization
- Player authentication and session management
- Leaderboard and statistics tracking

### 3. Smart Contracts (Contracts)
- Solana programs written in Rust
- $BIT token implementation
- Game reward distribution
- Community governance
- Buyback mechanism

### 4. Database
- PostgreSQL for persistent data storage
- Redis for real-time data and caching
- Player profiles and statistics
- Game history and achievements

## Technical Stack

## Data Flow

1. **Player Authentication**
   - User connects Solana wallet
   - Server verifies wallet ownership
   - JWT token issued for session management

2. **Room Creation/Joining**
   - Player requests new room or joins existing
   - Server creates WebSocket connection
   - Game state initialized

3. **Gameplay**
   - Real-time position updates via WebSocket
   - Collision detection on server
   - Health/armor calculations
   - Weapon effects and damage

4. **Rewards Distribution**
   - Game completion triggers smart contract
   - $BIT tokens distributed to winners
   - Leaderboard updated
   - Statistics recorded

## Security Considerations

1. **Wallet Security**
   - Secure wallet connection
   - Transaction signing verification
   - Anti-phishing measures

2. **Game Integrity**
   - Server-side validation
   - Anti-cheat mechanisms
   - Rate limiting

3. **Smart Contract Security**
   - Comprehensive testing
   - Audit trails
   - Emergency pause functionality

## Scalability

1. **Horizontal Scaling**
   - Multiple game servers
   - Load balancing
   - Database sharding

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Caching strategies
   - WebSocket connection pooling
   - Database indexing

## Monitoring and Analytics

1. **System Monitoring**
   - Server health checks
   - Performance metrics
   - Error tracking

2. **Game Analytics**
   - Player statistics
   - Game completion rates
   - Token distribution metrics

## Future Considerations

1. **Cross-Chain Integration**
   - Multi-chain support
   - Bridge implementations

2. **Enhanced Features**
   - AI-powered matchmaking
   - Advanced weapon customization
   - Tournament system

3. **Community Tools**
   - Content creation tools
   - Mod support
   - Community events
